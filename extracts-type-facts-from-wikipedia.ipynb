extract_type() function so that it extracts the type of the article entity from the content.\n","For example, for a content of \"Leicester is a beautiful English city in the UK\", it should return \"city\".\n","Exclude terms that are too abstract (\"member of...\", \"way of...\"), and try to extract exactly the noun(s).\n","You can also skip articles (e.g. return None) if you are not sure or if the text does not contain any type.\n","In order to ensure a fair evaluation, do not use any non-standard Python libraries except NLTK.\n","\n","Input:\n","April\n","April is the fourth month of the
